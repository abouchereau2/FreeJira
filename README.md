# Free Jira - Backlog tracking tool


##Overview
 - Free Jira is backlog management site where users can track and visualize Epics.
 - An Epic can contains Bugs, Tasks and other Epics. It can be in differet states: "confirmed", "work in progress" or "pending validation".
 - The app is built with Django and bootstrap. I choose Django because it is one of the top web development framework and has a big and supportive community. It is also fast, simple and reliable.
 - The UX design is very simple since I attached more importance on backend development than frontend for this exercise.
